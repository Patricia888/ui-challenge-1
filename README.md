# UI Challenge

This is a timed practice project focusing on improving CSS skills.

I built a single responsive webpage based off of the provided design comp assets. This webpage uses html and CSS, but no javascript.

It is designed in a mobile-first approach and is responsive when the screen size changes, with a breakpoint of 800 pixels.
